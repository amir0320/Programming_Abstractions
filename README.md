# Programming_Abstractions
I used the Stanford course CS 106B Winter 2016 material as a means to refresh my C++ skills. This repo contains my solution for the section practices and assignments.

You can find the Stanford C++ Library files on the official [course website](http://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs106b/cs106b.1164/).

For anyone who prefers some newer version of lectures and slides, you can check out the Winter 2018 [course website](http://stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs106b/cs106b.1184/index.shtml).

All rights and materials belong to Stanford, of course.
